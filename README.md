# Development of an Acute Concussion Triage Avatar (ACT-A): Leveraging LLM for Standardized Patient Summaries

Background: Concussion, a form of mild traumatic brain injury, is a significant problem that affects 150,000 Ontarians annually. Most individuals with concussion will recover within 1 to 3 months of their injury, however 15 to 30% of individuals will develop persisting post-concussion symptoms (PPCS). The prevalence of concussion highlights the need for effective triage systems.

Objective: To develop the Acute Concussion Triage Avatar (ACT-A), a triage tool to be used to identify individuals in the acute and sub-acute stages post-concussion who are at high-risk for persisting symptoms and poor outcomes who should be referred to and seen in specialized concussion clinics.

Results: ACT-A is a tool that integrates a speech recognition API to capture users' answers to a preset list of questions about them (e.g., their age, sex, etc.), their past medical history (e.g., previous concussions and/or other diagnoses), and their current concussion (e.g., when and how it occurred). Using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), ACT-A provides an accurate and standardized summary of the individual with concussion.
